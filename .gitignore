# Keras/TensorFlow saved model files (can be large)
# Only if you want to regenerate them from training code.
# If your assignment requires the trained model to be uploaded, then REMOVE this line.
# For this assignment, it seems you need the trained model, so keep `models/` OUT of .gitignore.

# Plot results
results/*.png
results/*.pdf
# If you want to upload the screenshot of the training plot, you'll upload it manually or
# exclude it from the pattern, e.g., only ignore other generated plots:
# results/training_history.png # If you want to ignore this particular file
# For this assignment, you need "Screenshots of results", which likely means images
# you take and put in README.md, not automatically generated plot files.
# So, ignoring generated plots is generally fine, then you just take a manual screenshot
# of the plot and put it in your README.
